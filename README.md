```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hiring
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

# Windows
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="%USERPROFILE%\.browser-use"

# Linux
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$HOME/.browser-use"
```

5. **Log into LinkedIn**
- Open LinkedIn in the Chrome browser you just started
- Log in with your credentials
- Keep this browser window open during analysis
